# matlab-code-for-maternal-and-fetal-heart-rate-extraction
This MATLAB project simulates and analyses biomedical signals for study of EEG and ECG processing. The first part generates EEG-like signals for different mental tasks and applies Welch power spectral density estimation to compare alpha, beta, and high-beta activity across tasks. The second part builds a synthetic abdominal ECG containing maternal and fetal components with baseline wander and noise, performs bandpass filtering and normalization, uses the fractional Fourier transform to detect and model maternal peaks, subtracts the maternal component, and applies wavelet denoising to estimate the fetal ECG and locate fetal QRS complexes. The scripts demonstrate skills in signal modelling, digital filtering, spectral analysis, FrFT, wavelet processing, and peak detection using MATLAB.
